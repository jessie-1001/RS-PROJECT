    "## 1. Title  \n",
    "**Enhancing Epsilon-Greedy: Adaptive Exploration Using Confidence Bounds**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Objective  \n",
    "Propose a novel hybrid Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm that dynamically adjusts the exploration rate ($\\epsilon$) in epsilon-greedy using uncertainty estimates from UCB. Compare its performance against standard epsilon-greedy, UCB, and EXP3 in stochastic and non-stationary environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Components  \n",
    "### Algorithm Design  \n",
    "- **Adaptive $\\epsilon$ Calculation**: At each step $t$, compute the maximum confidence bound width across all arms:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\epsilon_t = \\min\\left(1, k \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log t}{n_{\\min}}}\\right)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  where $n_{\\text{min}}$ is the minimum number of pulls for any arm, and $k$ is a tuning constant.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Execution**: With probability $\\epsilon_t$, explore uniformly; otherwise, exploit the arm with the highest empirical reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Scenarios  \n",
    "- **Stationary Bernoulli Bandits**: 5 arms with fixed success probabilities (e.g., [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]).\n",
    "- **Non-Stationary Setting**: Best arm changes midway through the experiment.\n",
    "- **Adversarial Setup**: Use EXP3 as a baseline for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics  \n",
    "- Cumulative regret over time.\n",
    "- Convergence speed to the optimal arm.\n",
    "- Sensitivity to parameters (e.g., $k$ in the hybrid, $\\epsilon$, UCB’s confidence level).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Novelty  \n",
    "- Integrates UCB’s uncertainty quantification into epsilon-greedy for **data-driven exploration**.\n",
    "- Simple to implement but addresses the limitation of fixed exploration in epsilon-greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Implementation Steps  \n",
    "1. Code the algorithms (epsilon-greedy, UCB, EXP3, hybrid).\n",
    "2. Simulate 1000 rounds for each scenario.\n",
    "3. Visualize results: Plot cumulative regret vs. time for all algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Expected Outcomes  \n",
    "- The hybrid algorithm achieves lower regret than vanilla epsilon-greedy in stationary settings and adapts better to non-stationary environments than UCB.\n",
    "- Provides practical guidance on choosing $k$ for dynamic exploration.\n",
    "\n",

    "5. **Discussion** (1.5 pages): Strengths/weaknesses of each algorithm.  \n",
    "6. **Conclusion** (0.5 pages): Summary and future work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Why It’s Interesting Yet Simple  \n",
    "- Avoids complex theoretical proofs; focuses on empirical analysis.  \n",
    "- The hybrid idea is intuitive and extends classical methods with minimal effort.  \n",
    "- Applications in A/B testing, recommendation systems, etc., can be discussed briefly.  \n",

    "The key difference between your **UCB-inspired adaptive ε-greedy** and existing **adaptive ε-greedy** algorithms lies in **how ε is adjusted** and the **underlying motivation for exploration**. Here’s a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **1. Existing Adaptive ε-Greedy (e.g., Tokic 2010)**  \n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Adjusts ε based on **reward gaps** between arms.  \n",
    "  - Example: If the best and second-best arms have similar estimated rewards, increase ε (explore more).  \n",
    "  - Tokic’s formula:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\epsilon_t = \\epsilon_{\\text{min}} + (\\epsilon_{\\text{max}} - \\epsilon_{\\text{min}}) \\cdot e^{-\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta_t}\n",
    "    $$  \n",
    "    where $ \\Delta_t $ is the reward gap between the best and second-best arm, and $ \\lambda $ tunes the decay rate.  \n",
    "- **Philosophy**: Focuses on **exploiting when rewards are certain** (large gaps) and **exploring when uncertain** (small gaps).  \n",
    "- **Limitation**: Relies on accurate reward gap estimation, which can fail if confidence in arm estimates is low (e.g., early stages or non-stationary environments).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Your UCB-Inspired Adaptive ε-Greedy**  \n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Adjusts ε based on **uncertainty in arm estimates** (UCB-style confidence bounds).  \n",
    "  - Example: If any arm has been under-sampled (high uncertainty), increase ε to prioritize exploration.  \n",
    "  - Your formula:  \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\epsilon_t = \\min\\left(1, \\, k \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log t}{n_{\\text{min}}}}\\right)\n",

    "- **Philosophy**: Prioritizes **exploration for arms with high uncertainty**, even if their current reward estimates are low (similar to UCB’s optimism under uncertainty).  \n",

    "- **Stationary Bandit**: Arms have fixed means [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5].  \n",
    "  - Tokic’s method: Quickly reduces ε as the reward gap between best (0.5) and second-best (0.4) becomes clear.  \n",
    "  - Your method: Explores more early on due to high uncertainty ($ n_{\\text{min}} $ is small), then reduces ε as confidence grows.  \n",
    "- **Non-Stationary Bandit**: Best arm switches midway.  \n",
    "  - Tokic’s method: May fail to detect the switch if the new gap is small.  \n",
    "  - Your method: Resumes exploration because $ n_{\\text{min}} $ resets for the new best arm, increasing ε.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Why Your Idea is Novel**  \n",
    "- **Combines Strengths**: UCB’s uncertainty-driven exploration + ε-greedy’s simplicity.  \n",
    "- **Non-Stationary Adaptation**: Unlike Tokic’s gap-based method, your algorithm naturally \"resets\" exploration when rewards change.  \n",
    "- **Empirical Focus**: While prior work (e.g., Vermorel & Mohri, 2005) compared hybrids empirically, your specific formula for $ \\epsilon_t $ is novel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. How to Validate the Difference**  \n",
    "In your experiments:  \n",
    "1. **Stationary Case**: Both methods should converge to low regret, but your algorithm may explore more early on.  \n",
    "2. **Non-Stationary Case**: Show that your method detects the best-arm switch faster than Tokic’s.  \n",
    "3. **High-Noise Case**: Add environments with overlapping reward distributions (e.g., means [0.45, 0.5, 0.55]). Your method will prioritize uncertain arms, while Tokic’s may under-explore due to small gaps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction makes your algorithm both novel and practical for real-world applications like A/B testing, where rewards can drift over time."

    "The exploration rate formula $\\epsilon_t = \\min\\left(1, \\, k \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log t}{n_{\\text{min}}}}\\right)$ is designed to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation by integrating concepts from both **UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)** and **ε-greedy** strategies. Here's a breakdown of its components and flexibility:\n",

    "### **1. Why the \"1\"?**\n",
    "The $\\min(1, \\dots)$ ensures $\\epsilon_t$ remains a valid probability (since exploration rates must lie in $[0, 1]$).  \n",
    "- **Origin**: Probabilistic constraints in ε-greedy algorithms.  \n",
    "- **Can you replace it?** Yes, but carefully:  \n",
    "  - Setting $\\min(c, \\dots)$ where $c < 1$ caps exploration (e.g., $\\min(0.5, \\dots)$ limits max exploration to 50%).  \n",
    "  - Trade-off: Lower $c$ reduces exploration, potentially missing optimal arms; $c=1$ allows full exploration when uncertainty is high.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Adaptive ε-greedy**:  \n",
    "  - Uses $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log t}{n_{\\text{min}}}}$, where $n_{\\text{min}} = \\min(n_1, ..., n_k)$, to focus exploration on the **least-pulled arm**.  \n",

    "- **Example**: $\\epsilon_t = \\min(0.8, \\dots)$  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: If over-exploration is costly (e.g., real-time trading), capping $\\epsilon_t$ prevents excessive risky exploration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) **Parameter Tuning**  \n",
    "- **$k$**: Controls aggressiveness of exploration.  \n",
    "  - Larger $k \\rightarrow$ more exploration.  \n",
    "  - Smaller $k \\rightarrow$ faster convergence to exploitation.  \n",

    "def _calculate_epsilon(self, c=1.0):  # `c` replaces the default \"1\"\n",
    "    n_min = np.min(self.counts) if np.all(self.counts > 0) else 1\n",

    "- **\"1\"**: Ensures valid probability; replaceable with $c \\in (0, 1]$ to limit exploration.  \n",
    "- **UCB Connection**: The term $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log t}{n_{\\text{min}}}}$ borrows UCB’s uncertainty quantification to guide exploration.  \n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Adjust $k$ and $c$ based on problem-specific needs (e.g., risk tolerance, time constraints).  \n",
